										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today [Reviewcoinx] a look at Quwiex Limited and decide, based on the information we have on this relatively new company, if Quwiex is likely a scam or actually a legit investment opportunity.</p>

<strong>Overall Rank:</strong> 95 out of 100</p>
<h2><strong>Quwiex Limited Overview</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://reviewcoinx.com/quwiex-review-scam-or-legit/">QUWIEX</a> is an international trading company. That uses innovative strategies on cryptocurrency exchanges to provide stable returns to its clients.</p>
<p>QUWIEX is located in 41 SHORTLAND STREET, AUCKLAND CENTRAL, AUCKLAND, 1010, New Zealand, it is <a href="https://www.nzwao.com/companies/quwiex-limited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> with the competent authorities, the founder is George Bennett.</p>

<h2><strong>How Does Quwiex Work?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://quwiex.com/en/?ref=YfRHOP2nDZN00LO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can check out Quwiex directly here.</a></p>
<p>It’s actually quite simple: You register for an account (you’ll need at least 1 wallet deposit codes where they can send you your money), you send cryptos there, you select your preferred deposit and enter the amount you want to invest, click enter and DONE.</p>
<p>The deposit will pay you the respective earnings daily 24 hours after you started your deposit for the deposit’s complete runtime.</p>
<h2><strong>How Does Quwiex Present Itself?</strong></h2>
<p>Quwiex has an official YouTube channel in which they publish their official videos. In their videos they emphasize on showing George Bennett, the founder of the company. I think It’s a good thing that he’s showing himself as the head of the company because that puts him in the spotlight and – it it were a scam or some kind of fraud – also on the target of people trying to come after him and Quwiex.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><div class="wonderplugin-video" style="width:600px;height:400px;position:relative;display:block;background-color:#000;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;margin:0 auto;" data-aspectratio="1.5"><iframe class="wpve-iframe" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1FZFl5bo0I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>They also provide high-quality footage of their employees which are branded inside the videos with Quwiex face masks and Quwiex apparel. I think they do that on purpose to show that they don’t need to use stock videos because they’re a real company.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><div class="wonderplugin-video" style="width:600px;height:400px;position:relative;display:block;background-color:#000;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;margin:0 auto;" data-aspectratio="1.5"><iframe class="wpve-iframe" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nulbolI2GOI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>They keep making the statement that they’re a legal company approved and bound by the laws of New Zealand. I think it’s great that they keep reminding everyone of that fact. My guess is that they want to separate themselves from the tons of scams and frauds out there to make sure not to be mixed up with the ponzi schemes in the crazy world we live in right now.</p>
<h2><strong>The Quwiex Website Is Pretty High-End!</strong></h2>
<p>One thing that’s one of the most common indicators of a crypto investment company being a scam is that their websites and backoffices have really bad design, don’t work properly and have a domain that’s registered for only 1 year.</p>
<p>Quwiex is the complete opposite. Their website has a great user experience, the user interface is designed beautifully, has a fast loading time and it’s responsive design is done correctly.</p>
<p>Also, their domain is registered until 2029 which is a very good sign that they are actually planning a long term future for the company, not a quick exit scam.</p>
<h2><strong>How Does Quwiex Make Money?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://quwiex.com/en/?ref=YfRHOP2nDZN00LO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to their website</a>, they make money with trading cryptocurrencies, specifically pairs trading, volatility trading, basket trading and arbitration.</p>
<p>So basically they get money from investors. The more investment partners they have, the more money they can use to trade, the more money they make. Obviously, they make a lot more money than they pay back as daily earnings to the investors.</p>
<p>I think that’s a pretty good deal for people who don’t know how to trade, themselves. I don’t, and I don’t want to spend my time trading crypto currencies on the computer all day. I’d much rather give my investment to someone else who uses it to make a profit for both of us.</p>

<h2><strong>What Types of Deposits Does Quwiex Offer?</strong></h2>
<p>You can open deposits in US Dollar, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The US Dollar deposits range from a minimal investment of $20 to a maximum investment of 1 million US Dollar at a time per deposit.</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of money you invest, your deposit will use that money for a specified amount of time. For example, an investment of $300 runs in the deposit called “<strong>Kron Light</strong>” and will run for 15 days, and will pay you you 1.00% – 1.40% of interest daily. After the 15 days, you’ll get your initial investment back.</p>

<p>A great feature of Quwiex is that they’ll show you what kind of profits you can expect when filling in the Deposit amount.</p>
<h2><strong>What About the Safety of the Investment?</strong></h2>
<p>In a Zoom call, the founder George Bennett stated that they have over 50 employees who are solely dedicated to risk management inside of the company. Based on the 1442 employees that they have, <a href="https://quwiex.com/en/?ref=YfRHOP2nDZN00LO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Quwiex’s website</a>, I think that might very well be possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://quwiex.com/en/?ref=YfRHOP2nDZN00LO"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3072 size-full" src="https://reviewcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/a72e1368705ea30f879071615b74e4fc_cropped.jpg" alt="" width="978" height="400" srcset="https://reviewcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/a72e1368705ea30f879071615b74e4fc_cropped.jpg 978w, https://reviewcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/a72e1368705ea30f879071615b74e4fc_cropped-300x123.jpg 300w, https://reviewcoinx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/a72e1368705ea30f879071615b74e4fc_cropped-768x314.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Withdrawing money from Quwiex</strong></h2>
<p>To do a withdrawal is pretty easy. Just please make sure that you’ll use the correct network so that your coins won’t get lost.</p>
<p>Go to the website, click “Withdrawal” and choose the cryptocurrency you want to get paid in. You can get paid in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, USDT and Tron. Enter the amount you want to withdraw (starts from $10) and click the button. Done.</p>
<h2><span id="How_Can_I_Invest_In_Quwiex" class="ez-toc-section"></span><strong>How Can I Invest In Quwiex?</strong></h2>
<p>You can start investing with Quwiex starting from $20. Just <a href="https://quwiex.com/en/?ref=YfRHOP2nDZN00LO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create an account</a>, fund it, choose your preferred deposit and start earning. When investing any amount between $20-$499, you’ll get your initial investment plus your profits back in 15 business days.</p>
<p>Currently, I have 2 deposits running, so I get paid twice every day. Here are my earnings since I started:</p>

<h2><strong>Final Verdict: Is Quwiex a Scam or Not?</strong></h2>
<p>Based on the information I have gathered on Quwiex so far, I’d say it really is a legit, official company that makes money, that works and that deserves a chance.</p>
<p>They present themselves very professionally, they seem to know what they’re talking about. The system works, I’ve gotten my money every day. They even have live chat support on their website that’s engaging and answers quickly. Their financial reportings seem legit. They are a legal company operating under the law of New Zealand, which is very strict. The companie’s founder states over and over that he and his team are not starting their company from nothing and that they’ve been trading together for years before deciding to expand as one company.</p>
<p>Obviously, with young companies like this you’ll never know for sure. I’ve tried it out, I like the service and I will keep investing with Quwiex.</p>
